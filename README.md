Users can view the current temperature, weather description, feels-like temperature, minimum and maximum temperature, humidity, windspeed, and pressure of their location or any other city they are interested in.

<h2> Installation and Usage </h2>
To run the application, you will need to install Android Studio 3.5.3 (latest version at time of development) and pull the project from github to a local repo. Afterwards, open the project from the top left button in android studio. You will find that your left bar with the title project is now populated with a bunch of folders.

Most importantly, the app folder contains most of the work used for development. At the top of the screen, you will find a dropdown tab with title Unknown Device. Open that tab and create a virtual device which allows you to run the app on an android emulator (for example, create a Nexus 5 device with Android 10.0 API 29 option).
